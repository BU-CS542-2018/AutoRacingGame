The codebase implements a starter agent that can solve a number of `universe` environments. Original website: https://github.com/openai/universe-starter-agent
It contains a basic implementation of the [A3C algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783), adapted for real-time environments.

`python train.py --num-workers 2 --env-id flashgames.NeonRace-v0 --log-dir /tmp/neonrace`

The command above will train an agent
It will see two workers that will be learning in parallel (`--num-workers` flag) and will output intermediate results into given directory.

The code will launch the following processes:
* worker-0 - a process that runs policy gradient
* worker-1 - a process identical to process-1, that uses different random noise from the environment
* ps - the parameter server, which synchronizes the parameters among the different workers
* tb - a tensorboard process for convenient display of the statistics of learning

Once you start the training process, it will create a tmux session with a window for each of these processes. You can connect to them by typing `tmux a` in the console.
Once in the tmux session, you can see all your windows with `ctrl-b w`.
To switch to window number 0, type: `ctrl-b 0`. Look up tmux documentation for more commands.

To access TensorBoard to see various monitoring metrics of the agent, open [http://localhost:12345/](http://localhost:12345/) in a browser.

Add '--visualise' toggle if you want to visualise the worker using env.render() as follows:

`python train.py --num-workers 2 --env-id flashgames.NeonRace-v0 --log-dir /tmp/neonrace --visualise`
